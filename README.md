Project Name
Data Analysis with Python using Pandas and Matplotlib

Description
This project is a Python script that performs data analysis on raw data using the Pandas library and generates visualizations using Matplotlib. The script allows you to analyze and explore various datasets, as well as display historical trends of the data.

Features
Data cleaning: The script preprocesses the raw data, handles missing values, removes duplicates, and performs necessary transformations to prepare it for analysis.

Data analysis: Utilizing the powerful Pandas library, the script provides functionalities for data aggregation, filtering, sorting, and grouping to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

Visualization: The project incorporates Matplotlib to create visual representations of the data, such as line charts, bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms. These visualizations help in understanding patterns, trends, and distributions within the data.

Historical analysis: The script includes features to analyze historical trends within the dataset. It allows you to explore how the data has changed over time, identify patterns, and make comparisons between different time periods.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pandas library
Matplotlib library
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/NeoLucem/statistics.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib
Usage
Place your raw data files in the appropriate directory within the project structure.

Open the script file analyze_data.py in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

Modify the script as needed to specify the file paths, data columns, and analysis requirements according to your dataset.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_data.py
The script will perform data analysis and generate visualizations based on your input. The results will be displayed in the console and saved as image files in the output directory.
